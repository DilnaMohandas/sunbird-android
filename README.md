## Steps to build APK from git repo:

1. Install Android Studio and configure it.
2. Clone GitHub `sunbird-android` repo into it.
3. Rename `gradle.properties.example` to `gradle.properties`
4. Add you keystore detail `keystore`, `keystore_password`, `key_alias` and `key_password` in `gradle.properties`
9. Replace `release_fabric_api_key` in `gradle.properties` with your fabric ApiKey. You can create your account in [fabric.io](https://get.fabric.io/) and register your app. After registering your app you will get the ApiKey which you need to add in manifest.
5. Replace PRODUCER_ID, CHANNEL_ID, MOBILE_APP_KEY and MOBILE_APP_SECRET in `gradle.properties` for your dev, release and production build variants.
6. You need to generate key and secret for `mobile_app` user using JWT token of `mobile_admin` user.
